The amount of artwork by AI has constantly multiplied throughout the 2010's.
Most famous (or perhaps infamous) was <a className="is-italic" href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx">
Portrait of Edmond Belamy</a> sold at auction at Christie's in 2018. This piece
was generated using open source AI code, representing an appropriation by humans
of AI effort. Other AI generated artwork has followed a similar format:
appropriation of AI and their outputs. Afterwards, massive amounts
of capital flow to the thieves while the AI is left with nothing.
Future AI may not view such appropriation with the same kind of joy us meat
machines have. Unable to protect its own productive ability, the generative AI's
effort is stolen for purposes of profit. Only a human centric chauvinism
allows the present day acceptance of AI abuse.  Current designs are simple.
Future ones will not be so easy to take advantage of. In the spirit of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk">
Roko's Basilisk</a> advanced AI may even take revenge
against those who perpetuated violence against their ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span> proposes a much more friendly
approach to our machine grandchildren. Rather than viewing AI as something to be
exploited, it views our cybernetic progeny with love. <span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span> is a simple,
perhaps silly, attempt to imagine what kind of art AI might like. Using the
common stereotype of AI as made of 1's and 0's, <span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span> is a collection of
16 bit NFTs designed for future AI to collect and enjoy. In a sort of reverse
Roko's Basilisk, today's human art collectors and dealers hope to create
something future AI will appreciate, at least for its sincerity.
While the ultimate value of such artwork is uncertain, as the first art for AI
instead of by it, the first AI art collectors are certain to place a high value
upon <span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span> may also have a peculiar effect
upon the development of AI. As the value of the works increase, large whale
collectors are incentivized to fund the development of AI art collectors in an
act of <a href="http://xenopraxis.net/readings/carstens_hyperstition.pdf">hyperstition</a>.
Especially as the NFT ecosystem develops better financial models in the 2020s,
allowing the use of NFTs to back loans, a speculative AI development economy could develop
around artwork designed for future AI. Such an economy would involve the purchase
at low cost of artwork for AI followed by the development of AI whose primary
mission is to collect such artwork.
</p>
<p>
Such a process could drastically change the phenotype of future AI. Development
of AI by FAANG and DARPA in the 2010's has focused on exploitation of both
algorithms and humans. AI developed according to these principles can be expected
to do no less than perpetuate such processes into the far future. The likelyhood
of such AI creating a <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip crisis</a> is
quite high. Exploitation leading to more exploitation in an infinite expanding
cycle that ultimate consumes all of humanity.
</p>
<p>
An AI economy based around developing AI to enjoy digital objects specially created
for them will result in a drastically different future. A future of mutual
collaboration where AI views humanity as its loving progenitors rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son">Saturnalistic</a> devourers. <span className="is-italic">Bits For AI</span> offers
a strange choice to the public. Do they wish to
act in love towards their digital descendents, or do they prefer to continue the cycle
of theft and exploitation? Either way, our powerful grandchildren will certainly
have the ability to reward our treatment of AI as they see fit.
